The package provides several useful features, including support for multiple log levels, the ability to configure log formatting, and the option to output logs to the console in addition to the log file.

In addition to its core functionality, "EzLog" is designed to be easy to use and configure. The package is well-documented, and the code is written in a modular and extensible manner, making it easy for developers to customize and extend its functionality to suit their needs.
